## [Unreleased]

## 2026-03-03 — Dean no longer fabricates dates or historical facts it can't verify

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User observation
**User feedback:** "Dean tells him 'Sunday Feb 23 — that's when you first reached out' when the user knows it was Feb 19. Dean then admits 'I don't have the full conversation history from Feb 23 forward.' That's a trust-destroying moment."
**Root cause:** Two issues: (1) the system prompt instructed Dean to "never be vague about dates" which encouraged confident fabrication of dates it couldn't verify; (2) no explicit instruction existed about Dean's memory limitations.
**Fix / Change:** Added a MEMORY AND DATA LIMITATIONS section to the system prompt clearly stating what Dean has access to (last 15 messages, RECENT WORKOUTS, profile, date context) and explicitly prohibiting statements about sign-up dates, first contact, or anything outside the data window. Also narrowed the "specific numbers" tone rule to only apply to paces and distances — not dates.

## 2026-03-03 — Workout recaps now always chronological

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User (Rachel)
**User feedback:** Rachel received a non-chronological recap when asking for past workouts
**Root cause:** The activity summary only gave Claude weekly aggregates, not individual workouts with dates. When asked to recap, Claude reconstructed individual workouts from conversation history which has no guaranteed order, resulting in out-of-order recaps.
**Fix / Change:** Added a `RECENT WORKOUTS (chronological, oldest first)` section to the activity summary in the system prompt. Lists up to the last 20 individual activities sorted oldest→newest with date, type, distance, pace, and elevation. Claude now always has a properly ordered workout list to reference.

## 2026-03-02 — Store manually-reported workouts from SMS

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Internal observation
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Activities table was only populated via Strava webhook. If a user texted "did a 10 mile run today at 8:30 pace", Claude would respond helpfully but the workout was invisible to all future coaching context — it never appeared in weekly mileage, pace trends, or activity summaries.
**Fix / Change:** Extended the existing Haiku extraction call (already runs fire-and-forget on every user_message) to also detect reported workouts. Extracts activity type, distance, duration, pace, elevation, and date offset. Writes a synthetic row to the `activities` table with `source: "manual"` and `strava_activity_id: null`. Includes dedup check (same user, same date, within 200m distance) to avoid double-counting if Strava sends the same activity later. Migration 010 makes `strava_activity_id` nullable and adds a `source` column.

## 2026-03-02 — Easy pace shown as range instead of exact value

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Internal observation
**User feedback:** "right now we are giving users exact paces based on VDOT. This means I get a lot of my runs at 7:44/mi pace exactly. I wonder if for easy runs we give a more round number or a range."
**Root cause:** `paces.ts` returns a single exact pace for all session types. Easy runs are effort-based and should flex with fatigue, heat, and terrain — an exact pace like 7:44/mi is counterproductive.
**Fix / Change:** Added `easyPaceRange()` helper in `paces.ts` that takes the stored exact easy pace, rounds to nearest 5 seconds, and adds 30s for the upper bound (e.g. 7:44 → 7:45–8:15/mi). Used at render time in the system prompt so the DB value stays exact. Tempo and interval paces unchanged.
**Files changed:** src/lib/paces.ts, src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-03-02 — Cleaner weekly plan formatting in SMS

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Internal observation
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Weekly plan prompts asked for "day by day" sessions but didn't specify line format, so Claude wrote sessions as flowing prose — a wall of text when 4-5 sessions were packed into one 480-char bubble. Also, `stripMarkdown` didn't remove `- ` bullet prefixes, which left dangling dashes if Claude used a list format.
**Fix / Change:** Updated `initial_plan` and `weekly_recap` prompts to require one session per line using a compact format (`Mon 3/2 · Easy 5mi @ 9:30/mi`). Added bullet prefix stripping (`^[-•]\s+`) to `stripMarkdown` as a safety net.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-03-02 — Implement opt-out handling for STOP and natural-language unsubscribe

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Internal
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** No opt-out handling existed. "STOP" may have been handled at the Linq/carrier level but our DB had no record of it, and all cron jobs would keep querying and attempting to message opted-out users. Natural-language opt-outs ("I don't want messages anymore") were treated as normal messages.
**Fix / Change:** Added messaging_opted_out boolean to users table (migration 009). Webhook now detects STOP/STOPALL/UNSUBSCRIBE/CANCEL/QUIT (exact keywords) and common natural-language patterns before doing any other processing — sets the flag, sends a confirmation, and stops. Subsequent inbound messages from opted-out users are silently ignored. All three cron jobs (morning, nightly, sunday) now filter out opted-out users.
**Files changed:** supabase/migrations/009_messaging_opted_out.sql, src/app/api/webhooks/linq/route.ts, src/app/api/cron/morning-workout/route.ts, src/app/api/cron/nightly-reminder/route.ts, src/app/api/cron/sunday-recap/route.ts

## 2026-03-02 — Require Dean to verify mileage totals match session sum before stating them

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** Jake
**User feedback:** "Dean said 'This week we are at 28 miles' but the key sessions only added up to 19 miles"
**Root cause:** Dean generated the weekly total and the individual sessions independently without cross-checking. LLMs are prone to this — stating a round number and then listing sessions that don't add up.
**Fix / Change:** Added MILEAGE ACCURACY instruction to both the weekly_recap and initial_plan prompts: verify the sum of all listed sessions matches any stated total before including it. If unsure, omit the total rather than guess.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-03-02 — Fix pace calculation: extract PRs from conversation, compute VDOT correctly

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** Jake
**User feedback:** "I gave Dean my 5K PR pace (5:40/mi) and he prescribes 9:40-10+/mi for base work"
**Root cause:** Three compounding issues: (1) extractAndPersistProfileUpdates had no pace/PR extraction at all — race times mentioned in conversation were silently dropped. (2) extractAdditionalFields didn't distinguish race pace from easy pace, and didn't extract race times for VDOT computation. (3) handleAnythingElse only checked the current message for race data, not earlier-captured onboardingData, so a PR mentioned in the first message was never used for VDOT. With paces null/TBD, Dean hallucinated slow paces from fitness_level alone.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Extracted VDOT pace logic into shared src/lib/paces.ts. (2) Added recent_race_distance_km + recent_race_time_minutes to extractAdditionalFields, with explicit rules to convert pace-based PRs to race times. (3) handleAnythingElse now falls back to onboardingData for race time if the current message has none. (4) extractAndPersistProfileUpdates now extracts PRs and easy pace, computes VDOT, and updates current_easy_pace / current_tempo_pace / current_interval_pace on training_profiles.
**Files changed:** src/lib/paces.ts (new), src/app/api/onboarding/handle/route.ts, src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-03-01 — Include message timestamps in conversation history passed to Dean

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** Gwyneth
**User feedback:** "Dean thought she did intervals yesterday since she hasn't texted with him since last Tuesday, which is when she did her intervals"
**Root cause:** created_at was fetched from the conversations table but silently dropped when formatting the conversation history for the prompt. Dean saw message content with no temporal context, so a message from 6 days ago looked identical to one from yesterday.
**Fix / Change:** Each conversation message now includes a formatted timestamp (e.g. "[Tue, Feb 25 at 6:12 PM]") in the history passed to Dean, using the user's local timezone. No schema changes needed — the data was already being fetched.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-03-01 — Fix morning cron firing for users who haven't completed onboarding

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User (Jake's wife received a stray workout message with no context)
**User feedback:** "it looks like my wife just got an accidental summary message: Wednesday Mar 4: 3 mi easy, flat, HR <150 — true recovery pace after those intervals. out of nowhere."
**Root cause:** morning-workout cron queried all users with a Strava token, with no check on onboarding_step. Users mid-onboarding or in a broken completed state could receive coaching messages they had no context for.
**Fix / Change:** Added .is("onboarding_step", null) and .not("phone_number", "is", null) to the morning cron query, matching the same guards used by the nightly-reminder and sunday-recap crons.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/cron/morning-workout/route.ts

## 2026-03-01 — Front-load name question into Dean's first message, remove awaiting_name step

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Internal
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Name was collected as a separate late-stage onboarding step (awaiting_name), making onboarding feel longer and more form-like than conversational.
**Fix / Change:** Updated the welcome message to introduce Dean, explain the value prop, and ask for the user's name and goal in one message. Removed awaiting_name from STEP_ORDER — name is now captured via extractAdditionalFields from the user's first reply. The awaiting_name handler is kept for any existing users already at that step.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/onboarding/handle/route.ts

## 2026-02-27 — Fix silent onboarding failure leaving users in broken completed state

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User (Jake's wife)
**User feedback:** User had no training_profiles row despite onboarding_step being null — never received any coaching messages
**Root cause:** `completeOnboarding` ran all three DB writes (`training_profiles` upsert, `training_state` upsert, `users` update) in a single `Promise.all`. If `training_profiles` failed (e.g. empty `training_days` array violating a constraint), the error was logged but `onboarding_step: null` still got written, permanently marking the user as complete with no profile.
**Fix / Change:** Split the writes — run `training_profiles` and `training_state` upserts first, check for errors and return early if either fails (leaving `onboarding_step` intact so the user can retry), then write `onboarding_step: null` only on success.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/onboarding/handle/route.ts

## 2026-02-27 — Landing page value prop revamp with real iOS screenshots

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Internal
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Value prop sections used placeholder SMS mockup components with hardcoded fake conversations; titles didn't match the actual product pitch.
**Fix / Change:** Replaced SmsMockup components with real iOS screenshots (Screenshot #1-3.png from /public). Updated section titles to "A personalized plan in minutes", "Smart adjustments for injury prevention", "Ask anything, any time". Rewrote descriptions to focus on user benefit. Removed all message array constants and SmsMockup import.
**Files changed:** src/app/page.tsx

## 2026-02-27 — Capture context shared in any onboarding step + persist post-onboarding profile updates

**Type:** Feature / Improvement
**Reported by:** User feedback
**User feedback:** "what if I share more context on what I want in an earlier onboarding step or later on say 'Can you add some strengthening exercises to prevent IT band syndrome to my plan?' Will those be handled properly?"
**Root cause:** Two gaps: (1) `extractAdditionalFields` only ran in `handleGoal`, so context shared during race-date or schedule steps (injuries, cross-training, preferences) was silently dropped. (2) Post-onboarding messages like "add strengthening to my plan" were answered in the moment but never written back to `training_profiles` or `onboarding_data`, so next week's plan wouldn't reflect them.
**Fix / Change:**
- Updated `extractAdditionalFields` to extract `injury_notes`, `crosstraining_tools`, and `other_notes` in addition to existing fields. Now captures richer context from every step.
- `handleRaceDate` and `handleSchedule` now run `extractAdditionalFields` in parallel with their primary parse call. Extra fields are merged into `onboarding_data` and `users.name` is updated if captured.
- Added `extractAndPersistProfileUpdates()` to `coach/respond` — a fire-and-forget Haiku call that runs on every `user_message` trigger, detects new injuries / cross-training / preferences, and writes them back to `training_profiles.injury_notes`, `training_profiles.crosstraining_tools`, and `users.onboarding_data.other_notes`. Future responses and plans now automatically reflect context the athlete shares at any point.

## 2026-02-27 — Acknowledge all onboarding context and surface it in the training plan

**Type:** Bug Fix + Improvement
**Reported by:** User testing
**User feedback:** "I would like to incorporate some strengthening so I don't get IT band or shin splint issues as I increase volume — after I said this, he just said 'What's your name?' He didn't acknowledge that strengthening is important. We should make sure to extract any relevant notes the user wants incorporated into their plan and make sure the plan reflects that."
**Root cause:** (1) `handleAnythingElse` only acknowledged if `extracted.injury_notes` was non-null. Strengthening preferences, injury prevention goals, cross-training requests, and general notes triggered no acknowledgment — Dean would skip straight to the next question. (2) `other_notes` from `extractAnythingElse` was stored in `onboarding_data` but never read by `buildSystemPrompt`, so the training plan had no visibility into it. `crosstraining_tools` was also missing from the system prompt.
**Fix / Change:** Replaced the narrow `acknowledgeInjury` call with a general `acknowledgeSharedInfo` function that runs in parallel with extraction (Haiku, no added latency). It acknowledges any substantive content — strengthening, injury prevention, cross-training, race history, target paces — and returns null only for "nope"/"nothing"-type replies. The acknowledgment is prepended before the next question so the athlete feels heard before we move on. Also added `other_notes` and `crosstraining_tools` to the coach system prompt so the initial plan and all subsequent responses can see and incorporate them.

## 2026-02-27 — Fix name extraction and add race-specific acknowledgment with web search

**Type:** Bug Fix + Feature
**Reported by:** User testing
**User feedback:** "when I just texted Dean this: 'Hey Dean! I'm prepping to run the broken arrow 46k in June' he said 'Love it, Dean - a 50K ultra is a great goal....' So he thought my name was Dean even though it's not and said the wrong distance for what I'm training for."
**Root cause:** (1) `extractAdditionalFields` matched "Hey Dean!" and extracted "Dean" as the athlete's name — the rule didn't exclude greetings addressed to Coach Dean. (2) "Broken Arrow 46K" was classified as goal "50k" and acknowledged as "a 50K ultra" even though the athlete stated the specific race name and distance.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Tightened the name extraction rule to only extract names from explicit self-introductions ("I'm [name]", "My name is [name]") and explicitly exclude greetings like "Hey Dean!". (2) Added `generateRaceAcknowledgment` — a parallel Sonnet + web search call that fires alongside the existing Haiku extraction in `handleGoal`. When a specific named race is mentioned, it searches for the race and returns one sentence of real course facts (distance, elevation, terrain). The acknowledgment becomes "Love it — Broken Arrow 46K is a 46km Sierra Nevada skyrace with ~10,200ft of gain" instead of "a 50K ultra is a great goal." Falls back to the template if no specific race is found. Also added `maxDuration = 60` to the onboarding handler.

## 2026-02-26 — Fix web search response cut-off and markdown leaking into SMS

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User testing
**User feedback:** "Seems like it may have worked, but something cut-off the response. Message response: which will slow your pace and tax your calves differently than road running."
**Root cause:** Two issues: (1) When Claude generates text, calls the web search tool mid-response, then continues generating, the Anthropic API returns multiple `text` content blocks. We were calling `.pop()` to get the last one — throwing away the first half of the response. (2) Claude occasionally uses markdown formatting (e.g. `**Pacing strategy:**`) when processing search results despite system prompt instructions; SMS renders it literally.
**Fix / Change:** Join all text blocks (not just the last) so split responses from mid-generation searches are reconstructed. Added `stripMarkdown()` applied to every outbound message to strip `**bold**`, `*italic*`, backticks, and headers before sending. Also bumped `max_tokens` from 1024 → 2048 to give web-search-augmented responses more room.

## 2026-02-26 — Fix typing indicator: fire early and keep alive during generation

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User testing + Linq support clarification
**User feedback:** "Definitely nothing we need to enable though, should be gtg. Can you explain how this is implemented? would like to take another swing at this"
**Root cause:** Two issues: (1) `startTyping` was called ~12+ seconds after the user's message (10s debounce + DB queries + coach/respond boot), so the user never saw it appear promptly. (2) Most platforms auto-clear the "..." indicator after 5-10s without a refresh call — Claude generation takes 8-15s, so the indicator was expiring before the message arrived.
**Fix / Change:** (1) In the webhook: call `startTyping` immediately after resolving chatId (before the 10s debounce), so the user sees "..." within ~1-2s of sending their message. (2) In coach/respond: run a background loop that calls `startTyping` every 4.5s concurrently with Claude generation, stopping as soon as the response is ready.

## 2026-02-26 — Web search for race/event-specific questions

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** User feedback
**User feedback:** "I told Coach Dean that the race I'm doing is called the Behind the Rocks Ultra. I asked him, 'Does he know what elevation looks like for that race and how we should make sure to tailor the training towards that?' This is a good case where he could go and search up the course, find the details, and make sure that the training plan corresponds to the race I'm doing."
**Root cause:** Coach Dean had no access to current or race-specific information. When athletes mentioned a specific race or trail, he could only respond with generic advice.
**Fix / Change:** Enabled Anthropic's built-in `web_search_20250305` tool on `user_message` and `initial_plan` triggers. Claude now searches proactively when an athlete mentions a specific race, event, or trail by name, or asks about something requiring current information (course details, elevation, terrain, cutoff times). Fixed content extraction to read the last text block in the response (not just `content[0]`), since web search responses contain multiple blocks. Added system prompt guidance on when to search vs. when to rely on existing knowledge.
**Files changed:** src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts

## 2026-02-26 — Typing indicators and read receipts via Linq API

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Jake
**User feedback:** "I would like to show a read receipt after Dean receives a message via webhook. I would like to show a typing indicator while we are working on a response to send to the user. The typing indicator should show for a short time if it's a short message Dean is sending, and show for a longer time if it's a longer message."
**Root cause:** Linq exposes `/v3/chats/{chatId}/typing` (POST/DELETE) and `/v3/chats/{chatId}/read` (POST) but we weren't using them. We also had no `chatId` stored per user, which is required for all three endpoints.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Added `linq_chat_id` column to `users` (migration 008). (2) Updated `linq.ts` to add `startTyping(chatId)`, `markRead(chatId)`, and `typingDurationMs(messageLength)` — the duration helper clamps between 1.5s and 8s at ~10ms/character so short replies feel snappy and longer ones feel considered. (3) In `coach/respond`: call `startTyping` before the Claude API call, record `typingStartMs`, then after generation compute `remaining = max(0, targetDuration - elapsed)` and wait that long before sending — this means generation time counts toward the typing window so we never add unnecessary delay. After `sendSMS`, capture the returned `chatId` and persist it to the user record if not already stored. (4) In `webhooks/linq`: extract `chatId` from the inbound payload (tries `chat_id`, `chatId`, `chat.id`), call `markRead` fire-and-forget immediately so the athlete sees a read receipt, and cache the `chatId` to the user row for future use. Added full console logging of returned chatId keys so we can confirm the real field name once live payloads come through.

## 2026-02-26 — Personalize onboarding with early name extraction + acknowledge injuries

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Jake
**User feedback:** "Next fix: I think we need to make sure that every response from Dean (including onboarding steps) is personalized... 1) Make sure that if name is included in the first message (or any other message), that we extract that and personalize future messages. 2) I noticed that we didn't actually acknowledge Ray's injury when she first shared it. We should acknowledge it and validate that we will consider it in the training plan." [Ray's first message was "Hi Dean! My name is Ray" — Dean never extracted it and still asked "What's your name?" at the end. When Ray shared a hip labrum surgery + bone spur recovery, Dean's response was just "What's your name?" — zero injury acknowledgment.]
**Root cause:** (1) `extractAdditionalFields` (called on every goal message) did not extract name — the `name` field was missing from its extraction prompt entirely. Dean always asked `awaiting_name` regardless of whether the name had already been provided. (2) `handleAnythingElse` saved extracted injury notes to `onboarding_data` but sent no acknowledgment — it just silently advanced to the next step question. The athlete felt unheard.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Added `name` to `extractAdditionalFields` prompt; if found, saved immediately to `users.name` and `onboarding_data` in `handleGoal`. Goal acknowledgment now personalized: "Love it, Ray — a 10K is a great goal." (2) `isStepSatisfied("awaiting_name")` now returns true when `data.name` is already set — the name question is skipped entirely for users who introduced themselves early. (3) Extracted shared `completeOnboarding()` function from `handleName` so both `handleName` and `handleAnythingElse` (when name pre-known) can trigger the profile write + `initial_plan`. (4) Added `acknowledgeInjury()` Haiku helper — generates a warm, specific 1-2 sentence acknowledgment. `handleAnythingElse` now: calls `acknowledgeInjury` when injury notes are present, prepends the ack to the next step question (e.g. "That sounds really tough — I'll keep volume conservative and avoid anything that could aggravate your hip.\n\nWhat's your name?"), or sends it as a standalone message before firing the initial plan when name is already known.

## 2026-02-25 — Add event tracking via Supabase events table

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Internal
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** No instrumentation existed — no visibility into onboarding completion rates, drop-off by step, or message volume.
**Fix / Change:** Created `src/lib/track.ts` with a `trackEvent(userId, eventName, properties?)` utility that inserts into a new `events` table. Fails silently (logs but never throws). Instrumented 7 events: `onboarding_started` (new user created in webhook), `onboarding_step_completed` (after each successful step advance — goal, race_date, days_per_week, anything_else, name — with relevant properties), `onboarding_completed` (in `after()` alongside the initial_plan trigger), `plan_generated` (initial_plan and weekly_recap triggers, with `plan_type`), `message_received` (every inbound message with `has_image`), `workout_logged` (after image activity insert with activity_type and distance), `coaching_response_sent` (every coach/respond success with trigger type). All calls use `void trackEvent(...)` to fire-and-forget without blocking the main path.

## 2026-02-25 — Fix day/date mismatch in coaching messages

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** Jake
**User feedback:** "It should be Thursday, Feb 26th so there's still a mismatch between the day of the week and actual date — Dean said tomorrow (Thursday, Feb 27)"
**Root cause:** `shortFormatter` produces date strings like `"Thu, Feb 26"` (comma inside the string). `upcomingDays.join(", ")` used the same comma as the list separator, producing `"Thu, Feb 26, Fri, Feb 27, Sat, Feb 28, ..."`. Claude couldn't reliably tell which commas were separators vs. part of the date format, causing it to misalign weekday names with dates by one position (associating Thursday with Feb 27 instead of Feb 26). Additionally, the next-7-days array was computed by adding raw milliseconds to `now`, which can drift in edge cases near timezone boundaries.
**Fix / Change:** Changed the list separator to `" | "` so it's unambiguous. Replaced `now.getTime() + n*86400000` with `Date.UTC(today_y, today_m, today_d + n)` — explicit calendar date arithmetic starting from today's date in the user's local timezone (derived via `Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-CA")`). This guarantees the weekday and date always align regardless of when during the day the function runs.

## 2026-02-25 — Image workout handling via Claude vision

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Internal observation
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Inbound Linq webhook only processed `type: "text"` parts. MMS image messages were silently dropped because the handler bailed on `!body`. No path existed to log, parse, or respond to workout screenshots.
**Fix / Change:** Webhook now detects image/media parts (tries `type: "image"`, `"media"`, `"mms"` and fields `value`, `url`, `media_url`). Full parts array is logged whenever a non-text part is present so field names can be verified against real Linq MMS payloads. When an image is detected for an onboarded user: (1) image URL fetched and converted to base64, (2) passed to Claude Sonnet vision with an explicit extraction prompt asking for `date`, `activity_type`, `distance_km/miles`, `duration_seconds`, `average_pace_per_mile/km`, `average_hr`, `elevation_gain`, and `splits`, (3) extracted data stored in `activities` table with `source: "image_upload"`, (4) `training_state.week_mileage_so_far` updated, (5) `coach/respond` called with new `workout_image` trigger carrying pre-extracted data directly (no DB lookup). Non-workout images (photos, memes) are routed to the standard `user_message` coaching path. Migration 006 makes `strava_activity_id` nullable to support non-Strava activity rows. `maxDuration` on the webhook increased to 60s to accommodate image fetch + vision call.

## 2026-02-25 — Collect athlete name during onboarding

**Type:** Feature
**Reported by:** Internal observation
**User feedback:** N/A
**Root cause:** Coach Dean had no way to learn the athlete's name during onboarding — messages were personalized with "this athlete" as fallback.
**Fix / Change:** Added `awaiting_name` as the final onboarding step, after `awaiting_anything_else`. Dean asks "What's your name?" and saves the response to `users.name` via `extractName` (Claude Haiku). The completion logic (training_profiles/training_state upserts + initial_plan trigger) moved from `handleAnythingElse` into the new `handleName` handler. `handleAnythingElse` now only extracts/merges data and advances to the next step. `coach/respond` already uses `user.name` in the system prompt, so all future messages (initial plan, morning workouts, post-run feedback) are addressed by name immediately.

## 2026-02-25 — Collapse onboarding from 8 steps to 3

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Rachel
**User feedback:** "Felt like a Google form but a little worse. I didn't know how many questions, and what exactly the goal was, when I was going to get to the end of the onboarding. I also mentioned my injury in the first text, but it only responded to it a bit later and felt like it wanted to just push through the full onboarding flow without being conversational."
**Root cause:** Onboarding had 7–8 sequential steps (experience, pacing, conversational pace, cross-training, schedule, preferences) before delivering any value. Felt like a form. Injuries and side info mentioned early were ignored until the appropriate step arrived. No end in sight for the user.
**Fix / Change:** Collapsed to 3 questions: (1) race date, (2) training schedule, (3) "anything else worth knowing?" The final open-ended question captures injuries, recent race times, paces, cross-training, and anything else the user volunteers — Claude Haiku extracts all fields from free-form text. VDOT paces computed from race times if provided. Steps are auto-skipped if data was already captured in an earlier message. Removed `awaiting_experience`, `awaiting_pacing`, `awaiting_conversational_pace`, `awaiting_crosstraining`, `awaiting_preferences` steps entirely. Removed `handleExperience`, `handleInjury`, `handlePacing`, `handleConversationalPace`, `handleCrossTraining`, `handlePreferences` handlers. Added `handleAnythingElse` and `extractAnythingElse`. No wrap-up SMS — initial plan fires immediately as the response. Proactive cadence defaults to `weekly_only` (no longer asked).

## 2026-02-25 — Fixed Dean sending wrong dates / off-by-one day errors

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User feedback
**User feedback:** "Okay, the next thing I wanna fix is I keep getting a lot of examples of Coach Dean sending dates and being off by a day or so. [example of 'Tomorrow (Thursday, Feb 27)' when today was Wednesday Feb 25]"
**Root cause:** Two issues: (1) New users who sign up via SMS never had a timezone stored — only Strava OAuth users got a timezone. This meant `user.timezone` was null, causing DATE CONTEXT to fall back to `America/New_York` regardless of where the user actually is. (2) The DATE CONTEXT only told Claude "Today is X" — Claude was then calculating relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Monday") itself and getting them wrong.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Created `src/lib/timezone.ts` with `inferTimezoneFromPhone()` — maps E.164 country codes to IANA timezones (e.g. +44 → Europe/London, +1 → America/New_York). This is called on new user insert in the Linq webhook so all SMS signups get a best-guess timezone immediately. (2) Extended DATE CONTEXT in `buildSystemPrompt` to pre-compute and explicitly list "Tomorrow: Thu, Feb 26" and "Next 7 days: ..." so Claude never has to calculate dates itself. (3) Fixed nightly-reminder fallback timezone from `America/Los_Angeles` to `America/New_York` for consistency.
**Files changed:** `src/lib/timezone.ts` (new), `src/app/api/webhooks/linq/route.ts`, `src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/nightly-reminder/route.ts`

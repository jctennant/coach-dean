## 2026-02-25 — Collapse onboarding from 8 steps to 3

**Type:** Improvement
**Reported by:** Rachel
**User feedback:** "Felt like a Google form but a little worse. I didn't know how many questions, and what exactly the goal was, when I was going to get to the end of the onboarding. I also mentioned my injury in the first text, but it only responded to it a bit later and felt like it wanted to just push through the full onboarding flow without being conversational."
**Root cause:** Onboarding had 7–8 sequential steps (experience, pacing, conversational pace, cross-training, schedule, preferences) before delivering any value. Felt like a form. Injuries and side info mentioned early were ignored until the appropriate step arrived. No end in sight for the user.
**Fix / Change:** Collapsed to 3 questions: (1) race date, (2) training schedule, (3) "anything else worth knowing?" The final open-ended question captures injuries, recent race times, paces, cross-training, and anything else the user volunteers — Claude Haiku extracts all fields from free-form text. VDOT paces computed from race times if provided. Steps are auto-skipped if data was already captured in an earlier message. Removed `awaiting_experience`, `awaiting_pacing`, `awaiting_conversational_pace`, `awaiting_crosstraining`, `awaiting_preferences` steps entirely. Removed `handleExperience`, `handleInjury`, `handlePacing`, `handleConversationalPace`, `handleCrossTraining`, `handlePreferences` handlers. Added `handleAnythingElse` and `extractAnythingElse`. No wrap-up SMS — initial plan fires immediately as the response. Proactive cadence defaults to `weekly_only` (no longer asked).
**Files changed:** src/app/api/onboarding/handle/route.ts

## 2026-02-25 — Fixed Dean sending wrong dates / off-by-one day errors

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Reported by:** User feedback
**User feedback:** "Okay, the next thing I wanna fix is I keep getting a lot of examples of Coach Dean sending dates and being off by a day or so. [example of 'Tomorrow (Thursday, Feb 27)' when today was Wednesday Feb 25]"
**Root cause:** Two issues: (1) New users who sign up via SMS never had a timezone stored — only Strava OAuth users got a timezone. This meant `user.timezone` was null, causing DATE CONTEXT to fall back to `America/New_York` regardless of where the user actually is. (2) The DATE CONTEXT only told Claude "Today is X" — Claude was then calculating relative dates ("tomorrow", "next Monday") itself and getting them wrong.
**Fix / Change:** (1) Created `src/lib/timezone.ts` with `inferTimezoneFromPhone()` — maps E.164 country codes to IANA timezones (e.g. +44 → Europe/London, +1 → America/New_York). This is called on new user insert in the Linq webhook so all SMS signups get a best-guess timezone immediately. (2) Extended DATE CONTEXT in `buildSystemPrompt` to pre-compute and explicitly list "Tomorrow: Thu, Feb 26" and "Next 7 days: ..." so Claude never has to calculate dates itself. (3) Fixed nightly-reminder fallback timezone from `America/Los_Angeles` to `America/New_York` for consistency.
**Files changed:** `src/lib/timezone.ts` (new), `src/app/api/webhooks/linq/route.ts`, `src/app/api/coach/respond/route.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/nightly-reminder/route.ts`
